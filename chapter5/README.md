CHAPTER 5 TOPICS

BOOK TOPICS

Test organisation (K2)
	Recognise the importance of independent testing. (K1)
	Explain the benefits and drawbacks of independent testing within an
organisation.
	Recognise the different team members to be considered for the creation of a
test team. (K1)
	Recall the tasks of typical test leader and tester. (K1)
Test planning and estimation (K3)
	Recognise the different levels and objectives of test planning. (K1)
	Summarise the purpose and content of the test plan, test design specification
and test procedure documents according to the Standard for Software Test
	Documentation (IEEE 829-1998). (K2)
	Differentiate between conceptually different test approaches, such as analyti-
cal model based methodical, process/standard compliant, dynamic/heuristic,
consultative and regression averse. (K2)
	Differentiate between the subject of test planning for a system and for
scheduling test execution. (K2)
	Write a test execution schedule for a given set of test cases, considering
prioritisation, and technical and logical dependencies.
	List test preparation and execution activities that should be considered
during test planning. (K1)
	Recall typical factors that influence the effort related to testing. (K1)
	Differentiate between two conceptually different estimation approaches: the
metrics-based approach and the expert-based approach. (K2)
	Recognise/justify adequate exit criteria for specific test levels and groups of
test cases (e.g. for integration testing, acceptance testing or test cases for
usability testing). (K2)
Test progress monitoring and control (K2)
	Recall common metrics used for monitoring test preparation and execution. (K1)
	Explain and compare test metrics for test reporting and test control (e.g. defects
found and fixed, and tests passed and failed) related to purpose and use.
	Summarise the purpose and content of the test summary report document
according to the Standard for Software Test Documentation (IEEE
829-1998).
Configuration management (K2)
	Summarise how configuration management supports testing.
Risk and testing (K2)
	Describe a risk as a possible problem that would threaten the achievement of
one or more stakeholdersâ€™ project objectives.
	Remember that risks are determined by likelihood (of happening) and impact
(harm resulting if it does happen). (K1)
	Distinguish between the project and product risks.
	Recognise typical product and project risks. (K1)
	Describe, using examples, how risk analysis and risk management may be
used for test planning.
Incident management (K3)
	Recognise the content of an incident report according to the Standard for
	Software Test Documentation (IEEE 829-1998). (K1)
Write an incident report covering the observation of a failure during testing.
