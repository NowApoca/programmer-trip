There are some basic rules in forms (checklist):

IF THERE ARE DEFINED VALUES, ALWAYS PUT A DROPDOWN WITH VALUE/LABEL. THE LABEL COULD BE DIFFERENT TO THE VALUE
ALWAYS SHOW WHICH FIELDS ARE VALID AND WHICH NOT
IF IT IS A DATE, PUT A DATE PICKER
INSTANT FEEDBACK FOR TEXT INPUT, NUMBER INPUT, EXISTING IDS, ETC.
ALWAYS HANDLE THE NECESARY INPUT TYPE
ENABLE AUTOCOMPLETE IF IT IS POSIBLE. PUT COMMON NAMES FOR COMMON FIELDS FOR RECOGNIZE AUTOCOMPLETE
USE PLACEHOLDER FOR FORMAT
USE VALIDATE REGEX IN CASE OF STRING
FEEDBACK FOR HOVER AND ON CLICKS OF BUTTONS
CHECK EVENTS AND STUFF
