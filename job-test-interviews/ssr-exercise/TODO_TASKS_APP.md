The idea of this exercise is to test several skills. The recommended stack is:

- ReactJS at the front, NextJS is optional.
- NodeJS at the back.
- Jest or Mocha for testing.
- A sql or nosql based persistance store like Mongo or SQL.

The user should do a app with the following requirements:

- A log in/ authenticate system using user password or OAuth2.0
- A signup system
- A forgot password system
- Home page with a view where lists are showed.
- A view with the points of the todo list
- Naviigtion for: Settings, LogOut, Home and create a new list

List:
	- A task could be added
	- '' could be deleted
	- '' could be check
	- '' could be archived, that means that is checked and should be in the place "Archive"
	- that should persist at the backend

THE WEB PAGE MUST BE PROGRESSIVE APP

Session should be persisted with a bearer token in the local storage of the browser

Things for evaluating:

- Right TDD methodology
- Well unit tests
- Well integration tests
- Well end to end tests
- Well architecture in both front and back
- Well implemented pipeline and CI CD
- A good performance
- Well progresive app designed
- Good practices in nodejs, reactjs and production deployment
- Good practices at git
- Use of domains
- use of setup a server
