General benefits of Microservices:

# Each service is relatively small (in comparision with the general project) so easy to understand and change
# Services are smaller and faster to test and run tests ( you have not to run the entire app for testing )
# Services can be deployed independently without start the entire app
# Each team owns his project, so multitaskin is no longer needed (And thats a problem, we link with DEVOPS practice summary)

# Each service is isolated, so if it falls it doesnt affect the entire app
# Languages can be mixed in the same system


General drawbacks of Microservices:

# It is more complex than a monolithic system
# Deal with partial failure is needed
# Developers must implement the internal communications
# Testing interactions is not easy
# Developer tools/IDEs are oriented toward building monolithic applications and donâ€™t provide explicit support for developing distributed applications ( not a strong point I guess )
# For deploying it is a little bit complex because you have to orchest many services
# Increased memory consumption

When we should use it?

# If it is the first version
# If the team is small
# If you need fast development and not scalate ur system
