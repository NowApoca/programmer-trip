CHAPTER 4 TOPICS

BOOK TOPICS

The test development process (K3)
	Differentiate between a test design specification, test case specification and
test procedure specification. (K2)
	Compare the terms test condition, test case and test procedure. (K2)
	Evaluate the quality of test cases in terms of clear traceability to the
requirements and expected results. (K2)
	Translate test cases into a well-structured test procedure specification at a
level of detail relevant to the knowledge of the testers.
Categories of test design techniques (K2)
	Recall reasons that both specification-based (black-box) and structure-based
(white-box) approaches to test case design are useful, and list the common
techniques for each. (K1)
	Explain the characteristics and differences between specification-based
testing, structure-based testing and experience-based testing.
Specification-based or black-box techniques (K3)
	Write test cases from given software models using equivalence
partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision tables and state
transition diagrams/tables.
	Explain the main purpose of each of the four techniques, what level and
type of testing could use the technique, and how coverage may be
measured. (K2)
	Explain the concept of use case testing and its benefits. (K2)
Structure-based or white-box techniques (K4)
	Describe the concept and importance of code coverage. (K2)
	Explain the concepts of statement and decision coverage, and understand
that these concepts can also be used at other test levels than component
testing (e.g. on business procedures at system level). (K2)
	Write test cases from given control flows using statement and decision test
design techniques. (K3)
	Assess statement and decision coverage for completeness with respect to
defined exit criteria.
Experience-based techniques (K2)
	Recall reasons for writing test cases based on intuition, experience and
knowledge about common defects. (K1)
	Compare experience-based techniques with specification-based testing
techniques.
Choosing test techniques (K2)
	Classify test design techniques according to their fitness to a given
context, for the test basis, respective models and software
characteristics.
