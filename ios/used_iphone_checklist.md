Thinking about getting a pre-owned iPhone? Don't miss these tips for buying a used iPhone safely and find out everything you need to check.

As you know we are experts in carrying out reviews of all kinds of used products. Today we are going to share with you all the secrets that you should keep in mind before buying a pre-owned iPhone. Don't let them take you for a ride!

Below, we explain in detail all the elements that you should check carefully.

What to check on a used iPhone?
Check the screen and exterior
The first step is to check the screen: no scratches or bumps. Check the back and sides, in general, the entire casing, and very importantly, that the camera glass is not damaged.

Check that the touchscreen is working properly, that all areas are working (iPhone 6+ usually have a sliding failure). And of course, check that the screen has not been replaced. If you notice that it has a yellow color around it or screws are missing, it may be that it has been repaired, if so, and the screen is not the original, it will end up yielding and will rise at the top after a few months due to the pressure we do with the finger on the "home" button.

How attached are you to your phone?
Take the test!
In an Android this does not happen in a generalized way, because depending on the model and its design, you do not always do so much force in the same place. This damage is not serious, the only thing you will have to change it again in time, the good news is that iPhone spare parts are usually not expensive.

The same goes for the case, ideally it should not have been changed. You can check this by checking its IMEI number, printed on the back. (It does not appear on all models).

Check connections
It is essential that you test:

The connectors, microphones and audio
Speakers (make a call and turn them on) and headphones.
Charging cable slits
The flashlight
It is also important to check that the GPS and compass are working properly.
Fingerprint as it is a common defect in second hand iPhones.


Camera and photo quality
Check that it goes well, take photos, videos and also a slow motion test.

You should check that the front and rear camera are working properly, it is best to take a picture and see if it comes out clear. The same with the flash, activate it and test that it pops up.

The front camera can tell you if the screen has been changed, as a speck of dust or other foreign body may have slipped between the camera and the screen during repair.

Physical buttons
Side buttons (the volume buttons can be faulty, check them well), the lock button and also the home button.

Wifi and Bluetooth
Test to activate the Bluetooth and connect the wifi to check that everything goes well.

iCloud account
Something essential when buying a used iPhone is that it does not have an associated iCloud account. Never buy an iPhone with associated ICloud, in the future you may be locked out of the account by the previous user.

To check this go to Home > Settings > and go to the iCloud tab.
Here you will see if it has an iCloud account associated with it. The seller must sign out and reset. If he doesn't, his account will remain registered and we won't be able to activate ours.

If no account is linked it should appear on the "Sign in" screen.

IMEI
What is the iPhone IMEI?
It is a unique identifier that each cell phone has. Among other things, it allows you to block your phone if it has been stolen.

How to see the IMEI on iPhone?
Press *#06# and it will appear on the screen.

Through the IMEI number we can check if an iPhone is blocked by iCloud.

Also through the IMEI we will be able to know very detailed information about the phone, such as: its brand and model, the date of the phone, when it was purchased, the capacity, the color, the last operator, and if the SIM is locked or not. You can check it on this website: Imeidata.net.

Battery and charger
And we come to the crown jewel: the battery, it is vital that you check if the battery charges well.

To buy the battery at the time of purchase, go to settings to "battery charge" and there you are going to see, while checking the phone, if it is running out very fast.

Something that can cause the battery to drain very quickly is that the volume controller is broken, and this is something that is a concern. For you to understand, it usually happens when you leave the phone overnight without using and in airplane mode and the next day has been paid (has not been able to consumed battery). What has happened? Well, it is most likely that the sound regulator is not working properly.
