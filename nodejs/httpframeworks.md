If youâ€™re looking for something stable with a lot of support Express is definitely a good choice. But if you want something more lightweight with newer features for a single page application, Koa might be the way to go. And if you are building something that needs to scale and be understood by large teams, Hapi is the winner. Performance is something to consider as well but it is outside the scope of this article. Whatever you choose, Express/Koa/Hapi coding!
