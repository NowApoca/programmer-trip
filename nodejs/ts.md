Typing isn’t a terrible idea, especially in larger teams. I am a big fan of optional-only typing for things like large complex javascript objects, so at least you know what that random thing is your getting in a method.
The main complaint against typescript is that we are compiling an interpreted language, and so we end up with the worst of both words … slow execution AND inflexibility/arcane build problems & root dependencies we can’t easily change.
I’ve always felt Javascript is simply the wrong language for alot of this, and we are sort of shoehorning in the convenience of typing behind levels of abstraction that doom us to deal with arcane errors. Plus typescript seems to be introducing all kinds of java style code-bloat. I’m working on a fairly large typescript project now, and I spend more time copy and pasting boilerplate than I do writing actual business logic. Biolerplate = bad — it’s arbitrary, encodes essentially zero real information,
Java developers seem to like typescript, because it’s familiar, and I get that.
Frankly, what we need is a non-javascript language, strongly typed, in the browsers and integrated with the DOM. The best features of compilation, performance, cannot exist with Javascript, and I’m not sure the typing pain is worth it unless the tool your using ( Angular, etc ) requires it.
