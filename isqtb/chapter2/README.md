CHAPTER 2 TOPICS

BOOK TOPICS

Software development models (K2)
	Understanding of the relationship between development, test activities and
work-products in the development life cycle, giving examples based on project
and product characteristics and context.
	Recognition that software development models must be adapted to the
context of project and product characteristics. (K1)
	Recall of reasons for different levels of testing, and characteristics of good
testing in any life-cycle model. (K1)

Test levels (K2)
	Be able to compare the different levels of testing, considering for each the:
	Major objectives.
	Typical objectives of testing.
	Typical targets of testing (e.g. functional or structural) and related
work-products.
	People who test.
	Types of defects and failures to be identified.
Test types (K2)
	Comparison of the four requirement types (functional, non-functional,
structural and change-related) by example.
	Recognition that functional and structural tests can occur at any level. (K1)
	Identification and description of non-functional test types based on
non-functional requirements.
	Identification and description of test types based on the analysis of a software
systemâ€™s structure or architecture.
	Explanation of the purpose of confirmation and regression testing.
Maintenance testing (K2)
	Recognition of differences between testing existing systems and new systems,
considering:
	Test types
	Triggers for testing
	Amount of testing
	Recall of reasons for maintenance testing (K1):
	Modification
	Migration
	Retirement
	Description of the role of regression testing and impact analysis in
maintenance testing.
