Waterfall is the one of the most common and traditional methodology used in project management. Waterfall model is commonly used in small projects where all the requirements are defined and there is no scope for change in the requirements.

Waterfall is a sequential linear design of steps where you cannot start the next one if you have stuff to do in the previous step. In waterfall project managment, requirements are set at the beginning and they cannot be modified once the lifecycle start.

Project managers prefer to use the project managment when:

There is a clear picture of the final product
Customers wont have possibilites to change requierements
There are not ambiguos requiremetns


Phases:


Requirements / Analysis

Basically requirements, inputs and outputs are defined

Design

System design and architecture defines hardware, techonlogy, system requirements, etc

Implementation / Coding

With inputs from system design, the software is split into small units. This is the coding phase where the requirements are converted into units which are integrated to create the completed product.

Testing

Normal testing stuff


Deployment / Installation

Deployment of the product in production


Maintenance

After Installation is completemented, modifications are made to the system or an individual component to alter attributes or improve performance.

Benefits:

Easy to follow, because requirements are well defined and they dont change on march

No overlapping: it allows you to organizing

Extensive documentation: It is a must

Easier to measure: no ambigouus requirements


Cons:

A delay in a step delay another steps

Requirements cannot change

No customer involvement in the process until the end

huge responsabilitis for project manager
