Scrum builds the application incrementally, with each increment adding and improving features and functionality created by its predecessors.

- Every member of the team understands their role and is aware of issues and tasks across the team.
- Issues are quickly identified and corrected.
- End users and customers see the team’s results quickly and provide timely feedback
- End users and customers refine existing requirements and provide new ones as the project progresses.
- Sponsors see the team’s progress as it takes place to eliminate wasteful activities such as formal and often repetitive status reports that detract from the time spent on actually developing a product.


Internal Roles:

Product Owner: Cordinates backlog, tasks and the idea of the product between specss, business people and development team. He updates the backlog

Scrum Master: The scrum master coach the develop team for reaching the goals of the sprint, priorizing issues, etc.

Development team: The team is typically cross-functional in terms of expertise and experience and the team as a whole is accountable for the delivery and quality of the application.

The business owner is the customer or customers together basically

Information entities:

Backlog: It defines requirements the application must meet in order to be successful. Requirements are expressed as user stories with format: “As a: <role> I want to: <function-description> So I can: <value-statement>”

Stories: basically a task in the above format

Saga: Sagas are bic picture features. As an example of saga with the above format:

```
“As a: end-user I want to: use an application that has exceptional performance and responds to my requests within a matter of seconds So I can: quickly complete my work and stay focused on my immediate task.”
```

Saga, stories and epic have same format. Saga is composed by epics and stories, epics are composed by stories.

Epics: A part of a saga

Stories: a part of an epic


Basically as atoms, molecules, organisms.

Processes or meetings or rituals, it depends on the persond that says it

There are five: sprint, sprint planning, the daily Scrum meeting, the sprint review, and the sprint retrospective

Sprint: Sprints are the iterations, often they size between 1 and 4 weeks. Duration is chosen by the team

- A fixed number or stories are assigned to each sprint

Sprint Planning: Here product owner define a goal and userstories that make that goal work. Also, the team sees how they will work together for completing the sprint.

Daily Scrum meeting or stand up: here they report progress and obstaculos or roadblocks. It is important to make some transparency across the team. Here the idea is not solving problems, it just reporting them. After the meet problems will be solved by the required people.

Sprint review: This meeting is an opportunity to get direct customer feedback on the state of the product, discuss issues and possible changes or new features, and to decide on what to do next.
The Sprint Review allows the Development Team to receive unfiltered feedback directly from the customer and involves both the customer and the Development Team in identifying next steps. In this respect the Sprint Review provides timely and relevant input to the next Sprint Planning session.

Sprint Retrospective: It is an internal meeting for continous improvement.

Missconceptions:

Scrum is applicable to all projects.
Incorrect. Waterfall methodology is a better match for projects required to meet highly stringent regulatory requirements which require that development pass through proscribed stage gates. Organizations must also be culturally suited to adopting Scrum since doing so requires not just acceptance by developers, but also by customers and managers whose experience is often limited to waterfall-style project management.

Scrum has no time or budget constraints.
Incorrect. In agile methodologies like Scrum resources and time are both fixed, while scope is not. Fixing resources and time sets an upper limit on the number of sprints in the project which means the project must deliver a minimum viable product that at least meets, and hopefully exceeds a threshold of user requirements by the end of the last sprint.
