Scrum better suits for products and development projects. Essentially, you select the work for the next sprint beforehand. You then lock the sprint, do all the work, and after a couple of sprints, your queue should be empty.
Kanban is better for production support. The limit here is not a Sprint, the limit is the size of the queues (each column of your board) called the Work in Progress (WIP) limit. It means you can change the items in the queues at any time, and that there is not end of working. It is always flowing.

There are many differences with scrum:

In Scrum, you split your organization into small, cross-functional, self-organizing teams. In Kanban, you don’t need to have cross-functional teams.
There are specific roles in Scrum but not in Kanban.
In Scrum, the daily stand-up meeting is the heartbeat of the project. In Kanban, it is not required.
In Scrum, you must split your work into a list of small, concrete deliverables. In Kanban, split the work into pieces, write each item on a card and put it on the wall. They don’t need to be deliverables.
In Scrum. you must split time into short fixed-length iterations (1–4 weeks), with potentially shippable software demonstrated after each iteration. In Kanban, it’s a continuous working, you don’t have iterations.
In Scrum, you must sort the list of deliberables by priority and estimate the relative effort of each item. In Kanban, you don’t estimate the work.
In Scrum, based on insights gained by inspecting the release after each iteration, optimize the release plan and update priorities in collaboration with the customer. In Kanban, this doesn’t happen.
In Scrum, you have events fixed events like Inception, Planning, Review and Retrospective. In Kanban, not.
In Scrum, you must optimize the process by having a retrospective after each iteration. Not in Kanban.
In Scrum, you must have a Product Backlog and Burn-down chart. You don’t have it in Kanban
