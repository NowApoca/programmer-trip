LEAN techniques help manufacturers and service-providers achieve the ideal outcome — delivering what customers want when they want it — while still keeping costs low, and having high flexibility and quality and fast turnaround times. More than a set of techniques, LEAN is a mindset of continuous improvement in the pursuit of perfection.

Five LEAN principles:

Specify value from the standpoint of the customer
Map the Value Chain or Value Stream
Create flow
Let customers pull value from upstream processes
Seek Perfection


Flow: 

Maximizing flow is about ensuring that the process is efficient and effective. The flow of material — or any other work item — through the process must be smooth and swift. Waste, variation, and overburden impede flow. IN DEVELOPMENT: Deploy must be swift and smooth

‘Pull’ is a supply chain management technique. The principle is to take action when the receiving customer (or process) signals a demand or orders it. By re-stocking only when we actually need to, we minimize overproduction and over-ordering. IN DEVELOPMENT: MANTAIN THAT SIMPLE, DONT ADD THINGS THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE. THings must be tested if you add them because no reason, that is time.

Value is specified by the customer. The series of activities that help create a product or service that a customer has value for, is called a Value Chain. IN DEVELOPMENT: WE HAVE TO IMPROVE VALUE, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.
