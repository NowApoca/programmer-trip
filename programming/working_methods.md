METHODS FOR WORKING AS SCRUM, EXTREME PROGRAMMING, ETC.

EXTREME PROGRAMMING (XP):

	It seems work for startups. Basically, it emphizes in getting fast demos and fast MVPs.
	It emphasizes business results first and takes an incremental, “get something started” approach to build the product, using continual testing and revision. It advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted. 
	Extreme Programming is one of Agile methodologies. It shares all Agile principles including strong customer involvement into the software development process, good communication inside of the teams, and iterative cycles of development.
	. It improves changes in the app
	. working over documentation
	. collaboration with the customer and not a contract
	. It works by bringing the whole team together in the presence of simple practices, with enough feedback to enable the team to see where they are and to tune the practices to their unique situation.

	You deliver the work in parts, not everything you could possible handle.

Each iteration of a extreme programming method consints in 5 steps: planning, designing, coding, testing and listening. We will explain them in more detail:

1. Planning. Here we met with the customers and translate user stories and requirements into tasks of the current iteration. We will have a first meet where we will estimate the whole plan and in each iteration we will delivery a part of the project. Here we should talk about some tasks and include them for asking and etc.


XP planning addresses two key questions in software development: predicting what will be accomplished by the due date, and determining what to do next. There are two key planning steps in XP, addressing these two questions:

	1) Customer presents features and programmers estimate cost of programming it
	2) Programmers works in iterations of 2 weeks and at the end of the 2 weeks delivery work, features and a demo in the middle if it is possible

Programmers could delivery small releases between the weeks for getting feedback.

2. Designing

- In XP, we do not add features that we dont use. 
- We stablish conventions of code
- Refactoring process is a must. We should have a day for that. For refactoring, we need a battery of tests.

3. Coding

- TDD is applied.
- Each member of the team could refactor any part of the code
- Coding standards should be talked
- Pair programming is something that I understund, but I dont know how it applies to small teams. Perhaps once a week.
- Continuous integration is a must
- Collective code ownership, everyone is responsible of the code.  It ensures that no one developer becomes a bottleneck for changes and it allows programmers to reuse any functionality that might be required by multiple user stories.

4. Testing

- We do not test in testing step, we test in code step. In testing step we check that our quality is reached
- Every unit test must run for considering a feature done

5. Extreme listening


Programmers must listen to what the customers and project managers need the system to do, what business value they want to provide.


ROLES IN EXTREME PROGRAMMING

Tracker: He just track progress and take actions depending on it
Customer: writes user stories and specifies functional tests. Sets priorities, explains stories, views CRC sessions. Often the product owner or some developer do it.
Programmer: Estimates stories and definies technical stuffs to do.
Tester: implements functional tests, analize graphs, do performance tests, etc
Coach: schedule meetings, make sure that the whole method is followed

Some roles can be mixed

ADVENTAGES OF EXTREME PROGRAMMING

- It allow programmers to focus on coding
- It saves from big changes at the end of the wheel
- it improves feedback
- always you have a deployable app
- code in xp projects simpler
- bugs are detected before they can hurt
- Everyone is part of the team
