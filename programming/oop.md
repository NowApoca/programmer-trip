Basically, oop is a way of programming where the programmer interact with entities as real life objects.

Glosario:

Class:
It is a template or blue print about the capability of what an object can do.

Object:
It’s the instance of a class/ it’s the working entity of a class.

method:

A routine of a class

Instance:
Object and Instance both are same with small difference.

Concepts:

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (instance variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit like a Class.
In encapsulation, the variables of a class can be made hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
It is something awesome because in general you decouple your code, making a ortogonal code.

Abstraction:
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. It concludes in that if you hide the implementation, you can change the implementation without changing the interface and nobody will be atacked.

The difference between concepts of encapsulation and abstraction is that encapsulation is about the packaging of the class (like how data should be accessed (setters/getters) and what data should be accessed (access specifiers)), whereas abstraction more about what the class does for you at a conceptual level.
Encapsulation is hiding unnecessary data in a capsule or unit and Abstraction is showing essential feature of an object

Inheritance:

Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.

Types Of Inheritance

Single Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance
Multi-Level Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance
Hybrid Inheritance

Advantages of inheritance are as follows:
Inheritance promotes reusability. When a class inherits or derives another class, it can access all the functionality of inherited class.
Reusability enhanced reliability. The base class code will be already tested and debugged.
As the existing code is reused, it leads to less development and maintenance costs.
Inheritance makes the sub classes follow a standard interface.
Inheritance helps to reduce code redundancy and supports code extensibility.
Inheritance facilitates creation of class libraries.

Disvetages:

Disadvantages of inheritance are as follows:
Inherited functions work slower than normal function as there is indirection.
Improper use of inheritance may lead to wrong solutions.
Often, data members in the base class are left unused which may lead to memory wastage.
Inheritance increases the coupling between base class and derived class. A change in base class will affect all the child classes.

Polymorphism:
In object-oriented programming, polymorphism (from the Greek meaning “having multiple forms”) is the characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts — specifically, to allow an entity such as a function, or an object to have more than one form.
