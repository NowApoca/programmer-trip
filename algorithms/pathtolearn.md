COMO RESOLVER EJERCICIOS?

REACTO stands for:
Repeat the question
Examples
Approach
Code
Test
O, as in Big O

Clarifying questions:
“Will the input array be sorted?”
“Can I expect there to always be one correct solution? Or could there be multiple or even none?”
“If there is more than one correct solution, do you want me to return all of them, or could I just return the first one I find?”


Don’t forget to talk about both your space and time complexity in Big O notation. Your interviewer will inevitably want to know, so be prepared to discuss this.
